# Problem Statement

Given a string, find the longest palindrome contained within it. Spaces are not counted as characters, and therefore should
not be included. If multiple palindromes exist of the same length, return the first palindrome. Uppercase letters and lowercase
letters should be treated as the same.

Example test cases:

Input string: 'Abba is cool'
Output: 'Abba'

Input string: 'Hannah was selected, while Anna was not'
Output: 'Hannah'
