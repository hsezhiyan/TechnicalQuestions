    "I'm not surprised. The Binomial Test attempts to calculate how likely an event is to occur by random chance. In the case of group C, 4.562% represents the probability that this many people would have bought the product by pure chance. Since this value is less than 0.05 (which is often used as a benchmark), it is unlikely to have happened randomnly, indicating higher relative preference of visitors to buy at this pricepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason I'm not surprised is that even though pricepoint C is higher, fewer visitors need to buy at this price to achieve the target proportion. Concretely, the target proportion for group C is 4.009%, and 4.982% bought (more than required). On the other hand, for group A, the target is 20.210% but only 18.968% bought (less than required). For group B, more people bought than required (10.984% vs. 10.054%), but the margin of difference was less than that for group A. Since data already suggested people tended to by at pricepoint C more than needed, this final result is unsurprising."
